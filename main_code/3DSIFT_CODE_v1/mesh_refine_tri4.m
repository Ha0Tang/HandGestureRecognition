% ---this method is not implemented, but the idea here remains...
% This can be done until some minimal distance (D) of the mean
% distance between vertices of all triangles is achieved.  If
% no D argument is given, the function refines the mesh once.
% Alternatively, it could be done until some minimum mean
% area of faces is achieved.  As is, it just refines once.

% NOTE
% The centroid is located one third of the way from each vertex to
% the midpoint of the opposite side. Each median divides the triangle
% into two equal areas; all the medians together divide it into six
% equal parts, and the lines from the median point to the vertices
% divide the whole into three equivalent triangles.
