This is the source code of the software SPAMS, which needs to be compiled before begin used.

There are several possible configurations. In particular, 
   - it should work with 32 and 64 bits operating systems.
   - Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
   - it can use either the netlib blas/lapack library, or the intel mkl
     library, or your favorite BLAS library (ACML for instance).
   - it can be compiled using either gcc for Linux and Mac (a recent gcc >= 4.5
     is recommended), Microsoft visual studio compiler for Windows and the
     intel compiler for all platforms.
   - it can either be used as an C++ library, or interfaced with Matlab, and it now
     comes with a preliminary R/Python interface.


Thei best way to compile the library is to open the file compile.m and follow instructions.

After all the mex-files are compiled, a script run_matlab.sh is also created,
at least for the Linux and/or Mac OS version. Depending on your configuration,
it might be necessary to launch matlab with the script in order to use the
toolbox (in order to preload multi-threading libraries).
Otherwise, just type "start_spams;" and use the SPAMS library.


For R/Python users, an interface with some instructions are available in the folder "swig"
